A scala project that provides types and basic functionality for working with [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs](https://stacspec.org). This library is the basis for projects like [Franklin](https://azavea.github.io/franklin/) and others.

### Usage

The following STAC types are covered by this library:
 - 2d- and 3d- Bounding Boxes
 - Collection
 - Asset
 - Catalog
 - Temporal and Spatial Extents
 - Item
 - License
 - Link & Link Types
 - Relations
 - Providers & Roles
 - Media Types

On its own this library does not provide much functionality; however, it can form a strong foundation for building catalogs and applications, especially when paired with libraries like [GeoTrellis Server](https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-server) and [GeoTrellis](https://geotrellis.io).

### Contributing

Contributions can be made via [pull requests](https://github.com/azavea/stac4s/pulls). You will need to fork the repository to your personal account, create a branch, update your fork, then make a pull request. Additionally, if you find a bug or have an idea for a feature/extension we would appreciate it if you opened an [issue](https://github.com/azavea/stac4s/issues) so we can work on a fix.

### Deployments, Releases, and Maintenance

`master` signals the current unreleased, actively developed codebase. Each release will have an associated `git tag` is handled automatically via a CI job once a tag is pushed. Releases are handled automatically in CI. To produce a release:

- make sure `master` is up-to-date: `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
- rotate changelog entries into a section for the version you're releasing using `chan release X.Y.Z`
- commit your changelog rotation: `git commit -am "Release X.Y.Z"`
- make and push an annotated tag for your release and push `master`:

```bash
$ git tag -s -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release version <version>"
$ git push origin --tags
$ git push origin master
```

After you've pushed the tag, create a GitHub release using `chan gh-release X.Y.Z`.

Active development and backports for a particular _minor_ version of `stac4s` will be tracked and maintained on a branch for that series (e.g. `series/0.1.x`, `series/0.2.x`, etc). Pull requests to backport a fix, feature, or other change should be made to that series' respective branch.

Care will be taken to try and maintain backwards binary compatibility for all minor and bugfix releases.
